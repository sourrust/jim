# Each mode handles key presses a bit differently.  For instance, typing an
# operator in visual mode immediately operates on the selected text. In normal
# mode Jim waits for a motion to follow the operator.  All of the modes'
# keyboard handling is defined here.
#
# Each mode's `onkeypress` is executed in the context of an instance of `Jim`.
# In normal and visual mode the current `@commandPart` is the current *part* of
# the command that's being typed.  For an operation, the operator is one *part*
# and the motion is another. `@commandPart` can one of the following:
#
#   * `{count}command`
#   * `{count}motion`
#   * `{count}operator`
#   * chars expected to follow a command (e.g. when `r` is pressed, the next
#     `@commandPart` will be the char that's used as the replacement)

# Shame the user in the console for not knowing their Jim commands.

# Each mode handles key presses a bit differently.  For instance, typing an
# operator in visual mode immediately operates on the selected text. In normal

# Each mode's `onkeypress` is executed in the context of an instance of `Jim`.

# Define an unmapped `Motion` that will be used for double operators (e.g. `cc`,
# `2yy`, `3d4d`).
